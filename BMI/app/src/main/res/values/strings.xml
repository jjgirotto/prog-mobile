    <string name="help">The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure for human body shape based on an
        individual\'s weight and height. It was devised between 1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath
        Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing "social physics". Body mass index is defined as
        the individual\'s body mass divided by the square of their height. The formulae universally used in
        medicine produce a unit of measure of kg/m2. A frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much
        an individual\'s body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her
        height. The weight excess or deficiency may, in part, be accounted for by body fat (adipose tissue)
        although other factors such as muscularity also affect BMI significantly. The WHO regards a BMI of
        less than 18.5 as underweight and may indicate malnutrition, an eating disorder, or other health
        problems, while a BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is considered
        obese. The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure for human body shape based on an
